Kafka-Tools
----------------

Kafka-Tools is a library containing tools to interact with kafka clusters and manage them.

Kafka-cluster-manager
---------------------
This tool provides a set of commands to manipulate and modify the cluster topology and get metrics for different states of the cluster. These include balancing the cluster-state, decommissioning brokers, evaluating metrics for the current state of the cluster. Each of these commands is as described below.

Rebalancing cluster
-------------------
This command provides the functionality to re-distribute partitions across the
cluster to bring it into a more balanced state. The goal is to load balance the
cluster based on the distribution of the replicas across replication-groups
(availability-zones or racks), distribution of partitions across the brokers,
ingress-rate load on leaders. The imbalance-state of cluster has been
characterized into 4 different layers.

Replica-distribution
--------------------
* Uniform distribution of replicas across replication-groups.

Partition distribution
----------------------
* Uniform distribution of partitions across groups and brokers.

Broker as leaders distribution
------------------------------
* Some brokers might be elected as leaders for more partitions than others. This creates load-imbalance for these brokers. Balancing this layer ensures the uniform election of brokers as leaders.

Configuration of kafka-clusters
-------------------------------

The cluster configuration is set-up by default from yaml files at /etc/kafka_discovery as <cluster-type>.yaml files

Sample configuration for scribe cluster at /etc/kafka_discovery/sample_type.yaml
